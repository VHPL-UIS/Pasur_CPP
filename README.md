# Pasur (Work In Progress)

Pasur is probably the first card game many of us played as kids. The core mechanic is simple: draw a card from your hand and sum the cards on the table to 11 with that one (though of course, there are more rules than that ðŸ™‚).

This project is currently a work in progress. The goal is to build a fully real-time online multiplayer version of the game by integrating the Nakama networking stack.

The game is developed using Cocos2d-x and C++, along with some free assets I found online.
